For 15 covariates, 100 samples, and 1000 tests, this should happen only about 463 times. So more than half of the time, we will be making false correlations, since we know everything is random! Conclusion: as you increase the number of covariates, you are more likely to make false correlations. The alpha error must be made smaller to compensate for this."
